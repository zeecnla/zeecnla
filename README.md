### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Cesar!

I love learning and hearing about complex problems and interesting solutions. When I am not coding I am playing video games or doing photography

Skills: .NET/ REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / SQL

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on side project, that I will not abandon in the dark hole of abandoned side projects, using .NET Core and ReactJs 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m planning to eventually learn Swift and dive into the mobile dev world.
